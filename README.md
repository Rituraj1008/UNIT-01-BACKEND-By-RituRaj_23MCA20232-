## Learning Outcomes

Through these experiments, you will:

- Gain hands-on experience with Node.js and Express for building back-end systems.
- Learn to perform CRUD operations on both JSON files and the file system.
- Understand how to manage and manipulate data using various back-end technologies.
- Develop skills in creating secure authentication systems using Node.js and React.js.
- Enhance your understanding of full-stack development by integrating front-end and back-end technologies.
